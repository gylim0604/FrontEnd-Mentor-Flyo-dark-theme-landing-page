## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - React component library
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - React form library
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I am once again trying to build more stuff with Next.js And Chakra-UI. For now still liking this combination, haven't encountered anything that would require alot of effort to work around. 

Important takeaways from this project is learning how to use Formik to simplify the form validation process. It definitely made it easier to do form control using the library as oppose to building everything for scratch. 

Another thing I got to delve more into was SVGs. Learnt abit more about svg properties such as the viewbox and how to handle fills. Will definetly be useful, and would want to understand it more. 

### Useful resources

- [Chakra Ui Form control](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/form/form-control) - The example here helped me figure out how to get Formik to work with Chakra. 
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/viewBox) - Helped me get a better understanding of the viewBox property for SVGs.
